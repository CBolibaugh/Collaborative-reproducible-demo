* Is a rendered version of an .Rmd generated by the `Papaja` package for APA formatted manuscripts that include R code and analyses (vignette)
* Has been rendered from .Rmd format to Google Doc format by the `Trackdown` package (See package vignette Collaborative Editing of Rmd (or Quarto / Rnw) Documents in Google Drive • trackdown)
   * “The trackdown package offers a simple solution for collaborative writing and editing of R Markdown documents. Using trackdown, the local .Rmd file can be uploaded as a plain-text file to Google Drive. By taking advantage of the easily readable Markdown syntax and the well-known online interface offered by Google Docs, collaborators can easily contribute to the writing and editing process. After integrating all authors’ contributions, the final document can be downloaded and rendered locally.”
* Contains plain text that can be collaboratively edited using Google doc track changes, version control and comments features.
* Contains properly formatted Markdown syntax and R code that should not be edited in the Google Doc. Please do not edit or remove placeholders of type "[[chunk-<name>]]" or "[[document-header]]"
* Please see package vignette for more information
* Please edit any R code within the source .Rmd. The latest version of the .Rmd can be found in the Github repository for the project. In order to make edits, please fork and clone the project, and then make a pull request with changes. Do not edit the file directly, or within Github. Further links on using Github
